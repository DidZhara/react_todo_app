# React Todo App

This project is a simple yet robust Todo application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing functionalities such as adding new todos, marking them as complete, editing their titles, deleting individual todos, toggling the completion status of all tasks, and clearing all completed tasks. The application also includes filtering options to view all, active, or completed todos, and provides error notifications for a better user experience.
